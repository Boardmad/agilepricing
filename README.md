 Octopus Energy Agile Pricing Sandbox

Some js and a bit of canvas.js graphing goodness to pull back T = 0 to -36hrs Agile costing

Ugly at the moment, 
Lot of redundant code
No graceful error handling!
But it works...

Retrieves endpoint for all agile tariffs,
parses and emits a series of inputs, 
selecting an input retrieves the half-hourly rates for that tariff and graphs them

TO DO:
Retrieve meter readings for an account and graph on costs
Work out cheapest 3 or 4hr period and show on graph
Clean up!
Error handling
